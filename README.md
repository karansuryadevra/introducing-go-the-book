# introducing-go-the-book

My code and notes from my reading the book "Introducing Go" by Caleb Doxsey
This is just an introduction to Go (as the book's name suggests) and I still have a few concepts to properly wrap my head around.
If anything, this is the equivalent of a scratch-pad that I have used to note down interesting features and implementations of various concepts with Go.
